        <h1>Volumetric Display Log — Krupal</h1>
<p><em>This is where I'm documenting LED display experiments. No structure, just thoughts and progress as it happens.</em></p>
<p>The following is my way through understanding and trying to make a volumetric display. Some parts of it are flagged nonchalant, they contain what is irrelevant to the volumetric thing.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Journey Begins [&gt;]</h2>
<p>It started with <strong>Voxon Photonics</strong> happening to my YT feed. It felt magical to me and a constant urge to make one for myself, I just want to hold it in my hands, and see with my naked eyes. But I was busy researching in maths (Ramsey's theorem) and distro hopping.</p>
<p>Then <strong>mitxela</strong> happened to my feed. With a candle. A what? A candle on a tiny rotating LED matrix which creates a <strong>POV</strong> (persistence of vision - your eyes see motion as continuous) to fake 3D. His setup: 8x10 LED matrix, a small DC motor, Li coin cell battery, rotate it fast enough, refresh the matrix proportionally fast enough and boom, you see 3D!</p>
<p>The ultimatum was <strong>James Brown's</strong> YT video. He dropped a banger, assembly video of this vortex, the fucking 128x64 LED matrix volumetric display. This guy plays doom on this! I couldn't wait much. I started building one.</p>
<p><strong>7th December</strong>, I ordered:
- 8x8 generic LED matrix with <strong>MAX7219 driver</strong> (chip that controls multiple LEDs)
- <strong>ESP8266</strong> (WiFi microcontroller)
- <strong>BLDC motor</strong> (brushless DC motor - more precise than regular motors)
- Some jumper wires</p>
<p>Labour leverage (Naval style), made GPT build an iterative LED matrix control board webpage for me.</p>
<p>Nothing worked, no LEDs on. Was thinking I got a wrong module, after scratching my ass on this for like two evenings, I realised the anodes and cathodes were interchanged. <strong>Lolol</strong> it light up and boom, I was now a hardware guy, I told to myself. <em>(I confirm I'm still not one)</em></p>
<p>Bought a 12V 2A power supply and started with BLDC, this shit won't calibrate for real. Bought an <strong>IR sensor</strong> (detects rotation) and again GPT for helping me measure the RPM of this motor. Had much fun with this!</p>
<p>But was running low with budget. A friend suggested <strong>bagel fund</strong>, I applied got <strong>$250</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Building Prototypes [*]</h2>
<p>Started designing my first prototype. My <strong>v0</strong> was named <em>kirmaadaa</em>, a friend suggested and I kept it. No James Brown inspiration, only mitxela and my own tinkering. I love <strong>Blender</strong> (3D modeling software), designed one, got it 3D printed, and it was rotating like crazy! I was thinking to transfer power wirelessly. Very scrappy design but gave it a go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>v0 rotating video</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Vibrations were crazy, design was not parametric (couldn't adjust dimensions easily).</p>
<p><strong>V1 coming in!</strong> Learned <strong>CAD</strong> (computer aided design), Fusion 360. Implemented a timing belt system, two <strong>ESP32</strong> (upgraded microcontrollers) instead of one. <strong>ESPNow communication</strong> (wireless communication protocol) between them. <strong>PCB designing</strong> (printed circuit board - custom electronic boards), Easy EDA. Watched the vortex assembly video for around <strong>60-80 times</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pavitra</strong>, building rockets back then and planes now, helped me with mechanical design. <strong>Mantra</strong>, an EC senior, helped with electronics a bit. Still code was a weak area for me.</p>
<p>The electronics did not change much:
- Custom PCB for driver and LED
- Modules for IR and <strong>encoder</strong> (position sensor) for RPM control</p>
<p><strong>Main highlight:</strong> custom <strong>slip ring implementation</strong> (device that allows power transfer while rotating). Seeing it spin at <strong>1800 RPM</strong> and transferring <strong>5V 5A</strong> current was gonna be cool!</p>

<h2>Learning &amp; Understanding [+]</h2>
<p>I paused this project. <strong>EV grant</strong> came in, learned more power electronics and general electronics from basics:
- Diodes, gates, timer IC
- <strong>PWM</strong> (pulse width modulation - controlling power)
- <strong>SPI/I2C</strong> (communication protocols)
- <strong>Buck-boost</strong> (voltage converters)
- <strong>AC-DC converters</strong>
- Some low level C programming</p>
<p>Most of my time went understanding what <strong>James Brown</strong> did, from his design to the code. <strong>Devin</strong> helped a lot in going through the <strong>git repo</strong> (code repository).</p>
<p>So the code has <strong>three main parts</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vortex</strong> - runs on RPI (Raspberry Pi - small computer) and lights up the actual matrix</li>
<li><strong>Virtex</strong> - OpenGL thing (graphics library), which simulates the actual display</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong> - helps import 3D objects and images to memory buffer which is read by virtex and vortex</li>
</ol>
<p>I learned <strong>OpenGL</strong> and much of computer graphics while going through the repo.</p>
